Here is some of the data that should be stored for each operation (mnemonic variation):
    - Opcode map #1 (or "implied leading opcode bytes"):
        A 5-bit number that goes into VEX.mmmmm. Detected through the opcode (required for VEX prefix).
        1 = 0F
        2 = 0F38
        3 = 0F3A
    - Opcode map #2 (or "implied prefixes"):
        A 2-bit number that goes into VEX.pp. Detected through the operation prefix (defaults to 0).
        0 = none
        1 = 66
        2 = F3
        3 = F2
